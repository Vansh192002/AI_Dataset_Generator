# AI Datast Generator!
Use it to generate large scale datasets with gemini integration to train LLM.
Simple to use :
Add your input file which contains questions for which you need to generate answers.
Mention the points the gemini should focus on while answering the questions in the criteria.txt(example provided in the file)
you need to have a json file which contains your gemini api key and google AI and ML credentials, it looks something like this (ambient-scope-xxxxxxxxxxx.json). Add the file path to your code and you are all set to go!
The script runs automatically until all the questions are answered and stores the answers to an output file.
